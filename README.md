**bazel.cmake** is a seamless submodule which aims to mimic the behavior of bazel to simplify the usability of CMake for **any mainstream operating systems** (Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Android, IOS). 

When launching a large open source project, We found that not everyone can adapt to the tremendous higher-level mechanisms CMake offered. We borrow the abstracts from [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) to make it easy for us to do so! Back to 2017, Bazel has not yet matured to support the manycore accelerators and even the most popular operating system - Windows. Maybe it's better now, but CMake is still the most powerful building tool for C++. So we will continue to support this project.
